Overview
This project was written as a part of Udacity’s  Python Foundation Nanodegree Program. Python script has been used to explore the data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
Data has been imported from the .CSV files provided and descriptive statistics has been computed on the same by answering interesting questions. An interactive experience has been created by getting raw user input to present these statistics.
Data set
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

Software Used
* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda.
* Python integrated development environment (IDE) – Spyder.

Statistics computed
Python script has been written to answer the following questions.
User statistics
1. What is the user type proportion?
2. What is the gender proportion ? (only applicable for New York and Chicago users)
3. What is the age of the youngest and oldest bikers? (only  NY and Chicago users)
4. What is the age of the most common bikers ? (only  NY and Chicago users)

Time statistics
5. On which month is the biker’s frequency high ?
6. On which day is the biker’s frequency high ?
7. What is the most frequent hour of travel?
Trip duration statistics
8. What is the total travel time?
9. What is the mean travel time?
10.  What is the longest and the shortest ride time ?
Station statistics
11.  What is the most popular start station?
12.  What is the most popular end station?
13.  What is the most popular trip ?
Detail statistics
14.  What is the user type of the longest and the shortest ride ?
15.  What is the age of the youngest and the oldest biker by user type ?
16.  What is the user stats referenced with gender?
17.  What is the longest ride taken from the most popular station?
18.  What is the total travel time of men and women ?
